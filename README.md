# flip-matrix-puzzle-game

A terminal python game where you can input a matrix.
Game will shuffle the rows and columns.
You have to unravel and restore the puzzle to it's initial position.
It's basically Rubik's cube, but you have the advantage of knowing each position so the difficulty is propotional to the size of matrix increase.

- Run the main.py

Why did I make this?

To feel more confortable with Matrix and making that utils.py which is reusable.
